Here are the steps to add authentication support
 # define [x UserInfo] model, used to send user information from server to client 
 # bind `UserInfo` as [http://google-guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/inject/Binder.html Guice Singleton]. This will make an UserInfo instance persist in all client, as if it were a static class.
 # define getUser [x action/result generator] and [x handler]
 # in `LandingPage` presenter, get user info from server. TODO how to handle if one has multiple places allowing anonymous use? check on all? 
 # when clicking on Sign In, display an OpenID login dialog

Although you won't be able to tell from UI yet, checking the Firebug console logs will show if user is signed in or not.
