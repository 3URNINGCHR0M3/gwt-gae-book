#summary Quality assurance

So far we developed a [basic app http://cultureshows.appspot.com/], which allows signing in with OpenID and managing performances schedule. Before we add more features, we need to look more at quality.

= Pre-requisites =
 * Make sure you have [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-gae-book/downloads/detail?name=CultureShows-0.3-before-QA.tgz the latest source code] for this chapter
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance General quality assurance]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality Software quality]

= When should QA start? =
If you answered at unit tests, or right at the beginning of development with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development Test-driven development], think again. What if you deliver a bug-free, but useless project to your customer?

QA should start when we [SoYouHaveAnIdea start defining requirements]. The later we fix defects, the more costly they are. A bad user story is much easier to fix before we actually implement it.

Let's see how we can increase quality for the main phases in a software project. Note that this is an iterative process which repeats continuously in a project, rather than being done in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model waterfall] way.



= Personae =

=  User stories =
Consider defining what is the project success is, what customer success is.

Priorities

peer reviews


= Metrics and KPIs =


= User interface =


= Software design =


design spec
pseudocode

= Code =

Careful on how much QA is invested in initial 1.0 *code*. Just did a major redesign, some would have been thrown away.


== Client unit testing ==

== UI testing ==

== Server testing ==

== Performance testing ==
is client first load waiting for server to say if signed in or not? Assume no and update UI when response received. 

== More ways to increase software quality ==
findbugs tool

= Deployment =

= Other areas =
Operations (monitoring availability, performance), support, marketing (campaigns success)...
