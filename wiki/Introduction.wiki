== Why a free, online book? ==
I'm an idealist :) I believe the world (both people and technology) is better through collaboration, sharing of knowledge and [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html right to read].

I personally avoid printed technical books as
* technology moves fast. A well prepared, printed material will usually be partially outdated by the time you purchase it.
* most of the contents which make up a technical book already exist online, in the form of blog posts, code samples, documentation, group discussions. If you want to make a full book about a technology, you'll usually duplicate existing content (remember the days with books having printed API reference as appendices?)
* authors usually get less than 10% from book sales. If you found this useful, feel free to make a donation.
