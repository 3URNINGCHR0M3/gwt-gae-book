Rather than writing a full book, gwt-gae-book complements existing online materials in a logical, structured, easy to follow way. With the help of community, this set of guides and samples intends to 
 * introduce engineers to GWT and GAE
 * show by example best practices and how to best achieve a desired functionality
 * complement and heavily reference existing online materials, rather than duplicating existing contents


= Why a free, online book? =

I believe the world (both people and technology) is better through collaboration, sharing of knowledge and [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html having the right to read]. By free education (even in the form of this small book), anybody has the choice of learning and getting better, rather than just the ones who can afford it. With free programming languages, libraries, tools and documentation, we'll see better applications, more and better collaborative ideas on improving them, and a better hiring market for software development companies. Will documentation writers die of hunger? No, they'll just have to consider developing applications for profit rather than writing books all life (which they probably already do). Hopefully donations will also help a little. Will publishing houses go bankrupt? Well, if they don't add any real value, maybe.

I personally avoid printed technical books as
 * technology moves fast. A well prepared, printed material will usually be partially outdated by the time you purchase it
 * most of the contents which make up a technical book already exist online, in the form of blog posts, code samples, documentation, group discussions. If you want to make a full book about a technology, you'll usually duplicate existing content (remember the days with books having printed API reference as appendices?)
 * authors usually get less than 10% from book sales.

= How to read this book =

Most of the sections have links to additional materials. Read the pre-requisites before going further and go through other references as you encounter them. 

There are also some exercises. Give your best shot at solving them rather than just reading the solution, it really helps. Who knows, you might even discover better ways of doing things. 

[http://code.google.com/p/gwt-gae-book/issues/entry Send feedback] by clicking on the envelope icon at the bottom of every page any time you have an addition to make or if something doesn't make sense. This book is a living material and you can help improve it.

= Acknowledgements =
These materials are not by far built from scratch. Most of them are usually adapted from or referencing existing online materials. Many thanks to the countless people which produced them. In particular, I'd like to thank for their contributions to GWT/GAE, guidance and help to Philippe Beaudoin, Christian Goudreau, John Patterson, Zack Grossbart.
