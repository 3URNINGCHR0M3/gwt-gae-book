#summary Listing saved schedule

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

Until now, we used the local datastore viewer to see what data is saved. Well, it's time to let Violeta see it too.

= Use cases =
Our basic need is a client to do [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete CRUD] operations on Performance entity items.

For the sake of example, let's consider some use cases which aren't really needed by Culture Shows, but might make sense in a larger app:
 * pagination (either in the form of prev/next pages or [http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/ContinuousScrolling continuous] / [http://www.infinite-scroll.com/ infinite] scrolling)
 * sorting
 * filtering
 * multi-user (changes made by others should appear real-time to current user)
 * offline usage

= Alternatives =

In order to get the latest schedule data and display it on client, we can do one of these:
 # get all items when page loads. When adding/updating/deleting items, send changes from client to server and if response is successful update the client list too. If multiple users would work on same entity, we won't see other users changes until a full page refresh. We also need to be careful on pagination, sorting, filtering.
 # when adding/updating/deleting items, send changes from client to server and receive back full data from server for the current client view (considering pagination, sorting, filtering). It solves the issues above, but it transfers too much data on each request.
 # 


 offline usage.
