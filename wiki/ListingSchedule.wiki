#summary Listing saved schedule

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

Until now, we used the local datastore viewer to see what data is saved. Well, it's time to let Violeta see it too.

= Getting latest schedule data =

In order to get the latest schedule data and display it on client, we can do one of these:
 # get schedule when page loads. When adding/updating/deleting items, send changes from client to server and if response is successful update the client list too. If multiple users would work on same schedule, we won't see other users changes until a full page refresh. We also need to be careful on pagination, sorting, filtering.
 # when adding/updating/deleting items, send changes from client to server and receive full data from server for the current client view (considering pagination, sorting, filtering). It solves the issues above, but it transfers too much data on each request.
 # 

We also need to consider offline usage.
