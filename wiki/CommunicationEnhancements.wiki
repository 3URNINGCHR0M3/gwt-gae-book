= Protecting against cross-site request forgeries (XSRF) =

*Pre-requisites*
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery Cross-site request forgery]

What's the problem we're trying to solve? If Violeta is signed in, and she navigates to badsite.com, then badsite.com can make some actions in our application on behalf of Violeta. Although [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy same origin policy] prevents badsite.com making !JavaScript calls, badsite.com can still load URLs such as
{{{
<img src="http://cultureshows.appspot.com/logout/" />
}}}
and log out Violeta for example. Other sites might even perform other actions on GET, such as `delete_contact.php?id=14`. 

One way to protect agains XSRF is to allow only requests which have your site as referral. A more effective way is to issue a token on user login, which can be stored by our application client in a cookie and cannot be accessed by badsite.com, then pass this token on each request and have the server check the token validity.
