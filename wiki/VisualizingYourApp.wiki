#summary Visualizing your application in action

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

You have a clear product backlog. Coding time, right? Let's do an imagination exercise first. Pretend all those user stories are already implemented. How would your application functionality look? Will it actually satisfy your personae's needs?

Let's try to illustrate how our UI would look like using [http://pencil.evolus.vn/en-US/Home.aspx Evolus Pencil], the best completely free mockup building tool I've found.

== Exercise ==
Make a few drafts of the UI by yourself before going further. Consider
 * [SoYouHaveAnIdea user stories]
 * user acquisition
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability usability]

== Landing page ==
Looking at the top user stories, could we cover these in the landing page?
 * As Violeta, I want to add/edit/delete the list of shows so that I can schedule them
 * As Violeta, I want to add shows to the schedule so that world is aware about them 
 * As Violeta, I want to schedule shows in various locations of my theater so that I use the best location for a show or do tours 
 * As Violeta, I want to edit existing scheduled shows so that I can correct any mistakes I might have done
 * As Violeta, I want to delete existing scheduled shows so that it reflects cancellations

[http://gwt-gae-book.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/assets/CultureShowsMocks.ep Mockups source]

As we target this application to Violeta, note that we let her enter directly some shows without even signing in, so she will be thrilled of how easy she can get results and be motivated to continue using it.

After a first draft of mockup you're happy with, brainstorm about it. For example:
 * fields in grid should be editable, so we avoid edit buttons? 
  * unintuitive to use and harder to implement
  * how about clicking on a row will fill the fields at top and "Schedule" button is replaced with "Update", "Delete from schedule" buttons?
 * how to delete entries?
 * show and location: text entry with auto-completion or combo boxes? 
 * need to edit shows to specify more details (summary, link to show homepage, actors). Could do via a "Manage shows" link at top
 * is this UI fully usable on touch-based devices?


= Get feedback =
You can usually find target personae among your friends, if you don't have access to direct customers yet. Get them to look over the diagrams above and provide you feedback both about your ideas and usability.
